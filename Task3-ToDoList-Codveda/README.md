# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and clean To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, as part of my internship tasks at **Codveda**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a basic task-management web app that allows users to:

* Add new tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks
* Store all tasks using **LocalStorage**, so data stays even after refreshing the page

It focuses on **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **persistent storage**.
